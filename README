Pn532 library
A library for Mifare Classic 1K
card reading


This library both provides and implements an abstract NFC super class.
The implementation is done for the pn532 specifically. With this library,
the pn532 is able to fully read a Mifare classic 1k card and is capable of
much more.

Apart from the abstract NFC interface, this library also provides an
abstract interface that can be used to implement different kinds of
communication methods. In this particular library the implemented
communciation methods are: i2c, SPI and HSU (High Speed UART).
The i2c and SPI communication protocols are fully implemented and use
a bit banged version provided in hwlib ( credits: Wouter Van Ooien). The
HSU implementation however is hardware based but is not implemented
completely (yet) .

Another extra feature of this library is that it comes equipped with a
decorator for the NFC class so it can work in combination with an oled
display.
The library also has various examples of how to use it’s functions to read
a Mifare card along with elaborated Doxygen lines.


This library makes use of a slightly customized hwlib. Therefore it is inlcuded in the code here. All credits of this library go to Wouter van Ooien.
