Default constructor for a received command. 

Since no command has been received, is\+Succes will be false \mbox{\Hypertarget{classreceivedCommand_a3bfe79f6fc149ea4c2f42a86fe5081cb}\label{classreceivedCommand_a3bfe79f6fc149ea4c2f42a86fe5081cb}}

Constructor for \hyperlink{classreceivedCommand}{received\+Command}. 

This constructor manages the proper layout for a command that the pn532 has send to the host controller. It will check wether the command has been succesfully received. It will remove preambles and trim the command to the correct size
