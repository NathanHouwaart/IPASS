\subsection{Detailed Description}
Example use of the nfc library to read a entire Mifare Classic 1k card with the pn532. 

This file will demonstrate how to use the nfc library to read a entire Mifare Classic 1k card. The declerations can be changed in order to write variable data to a different page.

Make sure the external G\+P\+IO pins of the pn532 are set to the proper protocol and match the protocol selected in this file.

G\+P\+IO pin layout\+: ~\newline
 P1 $\vert$ P2 = protocol\+: ~\newline
 0 $\vert$ 0 = U\+A\+RT ~\newline
 0 $\vert$ 1 = S\+PI ~\newline
 1 $\vert$ 0 = i2C ~\newline


After the pn532 class has been made, the pn532 first needs to be initialised. The S\+AM (Security Access Module) needs to be deactivated in order to setup te pn532 as a normal card reader. The pn532 will indefinitely try to activate a card within it\textquotesingle{}s RF field when the set\+Max\+Retries(0x\+F\+F) command is used.

After a card has entered the pn532\textquotesingle{}s rf field, the pn532 will try to read the full content of the card. It is doing so by authenticating every sector trailer block with the key specified in the struct card\+Keys in declerations.\+h

Possible error causes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The key is wrong for that specific vector
\item The access rights of the cards are set so that you can only autenticate with key A or B
\item The pn532 gave a timeout error
\item The pn532 has received a N\+A\+CK (Not A\+C\+Knowleged) frame
\item If one sector throws an authentication error, the rest of the card cannot be read. It needs to be reinitialised by the reader
\item The card is removed from the pn532\textquotesingle{}s rf field before completing the entire read
\end{DoxyItemize}

The error cause can be deducted by comapring the given error code with the errors declared in\+: \hyperlink{declarations_8h}{declarations.\+h}

After a full read ( succesfull, partial or not succesfull ), the complete Cardbuffer will be printed out in the terminal with the data that the pn532 has extracted form the card. Sectors that have not been read properly, will contain all 0\textquotesingle{}s (0x00)
