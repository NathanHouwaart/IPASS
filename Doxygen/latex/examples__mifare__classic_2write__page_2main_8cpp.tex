\subsection{Detailed Description}
Example use of the nfc library to write data to a mifare classic card with the pn532. 

This file will demonstrate how to use the nfc library to write a page of a mifare classic card. The declerations can be changed in order to write variable data to a different page.

Make sure the external G\+P\+IO pins of the pn532 are set to the proper protocol and match the protocol selected in this file

G\+P\+IO pin layout\+: ~\newline
 P1 $\vert$ P2 = protocol\+: ~\newline
 0 $\vert$ 0 = U\+A\+RT ~\newline
 0 $\vert$ 1 = S\+PI ~\newline
 1 $\vert$ 0 = i2C ~\newline


After the pn532 class has been made, the pn532 first needs to be initialised. The S\+AM (Security Access Module) needs to be deactivated in order to setup te pn532 as a normal card reader. The pn532 will indefinitely try to activate a card within it\textquotesingle{}s RF field when the set\+Max\+Retries() command is used.

Afther this the pn532 is setup properly to write a card. Before a page can be written, the sector the page is located in needs to be authenticated using the proper six byte key (default\+: 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff). Once authenticated, the mifare classic card allows the pages of that specific vector to be written.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
\+: If a sector trailer block is written in a wrong format, that specific sector might become corrupt/ unusable. Use care when writing to a sector trailer block!
\end{DoxyWarning}
Possible error causes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The key is wrong for that specific vector
\item The access rights of the cards are set so that you can only autenticate with key A or B
\item The pn532 gave a timeout error
\item The pn532 has received a N\+A\+CK (Not A\+C\+Knowleged) frame
\end{DoxyItemize}

The error cause can be deducted by comapring the given error code with the errors declared in\+: \hyperlink{declarations_8h}{declarations.\+h}

After a succesfull write, the pn532 will try to read the full content of the card. If the access bits / access keys have been changed using the write command, the pn532 may throw an authentication error. Update the \hyperlink{declarations_8h}{declarations.\+h} keys for a specific sector if the key has been changed.
