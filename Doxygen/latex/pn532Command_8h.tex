\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains two data objects that handle and trim the outgoing and received commands of a pn532. 

This file provides data objects that help standardize the received pn532 commands to a fixed format. Normally, the pn532 sends a frame to the host controller with information in response to a command send. However, depending on what interface is used, the frame might look a little different.

A general pn532 frame looks like\+:

0x00, 0x00, 0x\+FF, L\+EN, L\+CS, T\+FI, P\+D0, P\+D1, P\+Dn, D\+CS, 0x00

Where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0x00, 0x00, 0x\+FF = preamble (start of a command)
\item L\+EN = Length of the receiven command
\item L\+CS = Checksum of lenght
\item T\+FI = Frame identifier ( D4\+: host -\/$>$ pn532. D5\+: pn542 -\/$>$ host)
\item P\+D0, P\+D1, P\+Dn = Packed data
\item D\+CS = Packed data Checksum
\item 0x00 = Postamble (end of a command)
\end{DoxyItemize}
