 * @brief    Data object for a nfc card where data can be stored in
 * 
 * This file provides a data object where a nfc reader can store the read cardinformation in. For now,
 * this card is fixed for just a Mifare classic 1k card. In the future templates will be added
 * so that the user can initialise a card class for any card.
