 * @brief     Abstract nfc class that can be implemented for any nfc reader
 * 
 * This file contains the abstract interface for any nfc reader.
 * You can inherit from this class and overwrite its abstract functions.
 * 
 * If you do so, you can use the format:
 * 
 *  nfc::NFC* nfc = &YOUR_NFC_CLASS( constructor arguments ); 
 *  nfc->getFirmwareversion();
 *  nfc->getGeneralStatus(); 
 *  
 *  And so on..
