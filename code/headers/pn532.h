 * @brief    Implementation of the Abstract NFC interface for the pn532
 * 
 * This file provides an implementation of the Abstract NFC interface class that can be used by a pn532.
 * @note    Not all commands that he pn532 provides are supported by this library, but the vast majority 
 *          is implemented. 
 * 
 * This file contains detailled doxygen lines, but if a particulair function of thepn532 is not clear, plese 
 * refer to the user manual of this chip:
 * https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/141520.pdf 
 * 
 * You can also refer to the application note in order to see how the pn532 is used to read cards/ etc:
 * https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/nxp/application-notes/AN133910.pdf 
 * 
 * The pn532 is manufactured by NXP®. All rights reserved
 * 
 * PN532 NFC RFID Module is a highly integrated transmission module for Near Field Communication at 13.56MHz. With the mode 
 * switch on board, you can change easily between I2C, SPI, and UART modes. The integrated level shifter provides 3.3V or 5V 
 * working voltage for your choice. In addition, it supports RFID reading and writing, and NFC function with Android phone, 
 * which makes it quite convenient for wireless connection. This module is equipped with two 3mm mounting holes, of which the 
 * small dimension makes it easy for using in your project! (source: http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=PN532_NFC_RFID_Module )
 * 
 * Note: When your wiring is correct (no short circuit), the module may be a little heated, which is just normal for use.
